#Hussain's lovely code: 

class Member:

    def __init__(self, name, age, location):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.location = location
        self.friends = []

    def add_friend(self, member):
        self.friends.append(member)

    def add_relationship(self, member):
        if member not in self.friends:
            self.add_friend(member)
            member.add_friend(self)
