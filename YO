# create members
alice = Member("Alice", 18, "New York")
bob = Member("Bob", 19, "Los Angeles")
charlie = Member("Charlie", 32, "Saudi Arabia")
david = Member("David", 44, "US")

# Add relationships
alice.add_relationship(bob)

# Find all the friends of Alice

# Find the shortest path between Alice and David
